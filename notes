I'm going to be trying to make some tree-ish graphing.
Basically, start with a point, make from it 3 lines of equal length.
From each end of the line make 3 new lines of equal length.
Preferrable the line making should be animated
If a line touches an already made line it stops growing and it is marked as "dead", meaning it would not itself split.
Repeat until no more lines are being made! (maybe).

Should be made with LÃ¶ve.
