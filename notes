I'm going to be trying to make some tree-ish graphing.
Basically, start with a point, make from it 3 lines of equal length.
From each end of the line make 3 new lines of equal length.
Preferrable the line making should be animated
If a line touches an already made line it stops growing and it is marked as "dead", meaning it would not itself split.
Repeat until no more lines are being made! (maybe).

Should be made with LÃ¶ve.

Also, to do :
 Add the ability to make a coordinate line from a line given a point from it and a directing vector
 can be used to project a point on a line and get the resulting line coordinate.

 I also need to get an orthogonal projection point coordinates. It would be incredibly useful for me to have so.
